# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis is a data analytics process to understand the data in depth and find different patterns, relations, and anomalies in the data using some statistical graphs and other visualization techniques.

The main purpose of EDA is to detect any errors, or outliers as well as to understand different patterns in the data.

❑ A major part of EDA:

➢ Get maximum insights from a data set

➢ Extract important variables from the dataset

➢ Detect outliers and Handling
